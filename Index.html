  Desktop computers are fixed computing systems comprising a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and processing unit. They vary in configurations tailored to specific needs,<br> from basic setups for everyday tasks to high-performance rigs for gaming, design, or scientific computing. Key components include the CPU, RAM, storage drives,<br> GPU, and motherboard. They offer advantages like upgradability, customization, and superior performance over laptops or tablets. While lacking portability, desktops <br>are preferred for their robustness and versatility, finding applications in offices, homes, and industries. Despite the rise of portable devices, desktops continue to evolve <br>with compact designs, improved energy efficiency, and enhanced connectivity, maintaining their relevance in the computing landscape.
